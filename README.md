# Healthcare Insurance Loss Simulation Model

This project models insurance claim frequency and severity using stochastic methods.

## Model Structure
- Claim frequency modeled as Poisson distribution
- Claim severity modeled as Lognormal distribution
- Deductible and policy limit applied to each claim
- Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 policy years)

## Outputs
- Expected annual loss
- Variance and standard deviation
- Indicated premium with 20% loading
- Loss distribution visualization

## Purpose
Demonstrates actuarial modeling techniques relevant to healthcare and insurance pricing.
